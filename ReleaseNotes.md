Dependent stacks can select the results from other stacks by specifying a prefix per stack.

# Release 1.0.8-alpha - 11/03/2019

New visitors are now greeted by a welcome page (with dummy content for now) that will explain the goal and workings of
the application. The workspace dashboard is prepared to be converted to a workspace welcome / onboarding page. Onboarding is done on this page and it is no longer required to visit a playground. Members of the workspace will skip this page and are 
automatically directed to the action page.
